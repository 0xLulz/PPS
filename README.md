# PPS
## PPS Module for Python3.0
Quick fix for a friend's module that he converted from a V source of mine.

## How to use
Include the file in your project directory and import the file in your main project file
```
from pps import *
```
Call the `run()` function from the 'GetCurrent' class
```
GetCurrent.run()
```

# PPS
## PPS Module for Python3.0
Quick fix for a friend's module that he converted from a V source of mine.

## How to use
Include the file in your project directory and import the file in your main project file
```
In a sub-directory -> from .pps import *
In parent directory -> import pps
```
Call the `run()` function from the 'GetCurrent' class
```
PPS.run()
```
